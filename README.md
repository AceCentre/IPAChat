what does this do?

We are wondering (Well with Andrea Lee) about the idea of using IPA (Phonemes) to construct messages in place of symbols for children. IPA is strange syntax but if you learn the sounds youc can babble and make any new words up and speak

In iOS there is a IPA notation API. We figured lets try hacking a quick app together to try it out. 

The search feature allows you to look up the IPA notation of a word. This is from: https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict

We currently support french and English but ideally we should support as many languages as you can in iOS. Note the phonemes are different for different languages

We need to check all voices (or which voices) support this IPA Notation. 

Ideally we would like a way of putting your own images on phoneme buttons and moving them around. We have started the moving process in settings but it is ugly.
